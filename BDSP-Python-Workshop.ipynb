    "\n",
    "However, this approach is not recommended. It is convinient if you will use many functions or you don't know for which function you are looking for. But the downsite is that you will load lots of functions that you don't need. Ultimately, make your code heavier and more difficult to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding an alias \n",
    "Example: ```import pandas as pd```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a function coming from a library, you have to reference where that function comes from. For example, when you use the function *read_csv* from the package pandas, you might have to type ```pandas.read_csv()```. To avoid typing the word pandas every time, you can give a shorter alias like pd. If you import the package with an alias, typing the same function would become ```pd.read_csv()```. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing only what you need\n",
    "Example: ```from math import pi```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the prefered approach. Only put in your plate what you are going to eat. Interestingly, when you only import one function, you don't need anymore to add the name of the package at the beginning of the function. In other words, when you type ```from math import pi```, you won't have to type ```math.pi```, you can just type ```pi``` and it will work."
